# Real-Time Translator: English Text, PDF & Images Translation/Video Captioning

This project is a Python-based tool that combines **speech recognition**, **text extraction**, and **language translation** to process and translate **video**, **PDF**, and **image** files into **Konkani (gom)** or any other supported language. It uses a combination of `OpenAI Whisper`, `Tesseract OCR`, and `Google Translate` for a robust multimodal translation pipeline.
